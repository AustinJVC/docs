title: Error Handling
description: When interacting with any API, it's crucial to understand how to interpret and handle errors. Our API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request, along with a consistent JSON error response format to provide more specific details.

## HTTP Status Codes
Here are the common HTTP status codes you might encounter:

``200 OK``: The request was successful.

``201 Created``: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.

``204 No Content``: The request was successful, but there is no content to return (e.g., a successful deletion).

``400 Bad Request``: The request was malformed or invalid (e.g., missing required parameters, invalid JSON format).

``401 Unauthorized``: Authentication failed or was not provided (e.g., missing or invalid X-API-KEY).

``403 Forbidden``: The authenticated user does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource or perform the action.

``404 Not Found``: The requested resource could not be found.

``405 Method Not Allowed``: The HTTP method used is not supported for the requested resource (e.g., trying to POST to a GET-only endpoint).

``429 Too Many Requests``: You have exceeded the API's rate limits.

``500 Internal Server Error``: A generic error occurred on our server. This usually indicates an unexpected issue on our end.

## Error Response Structure
When an error occurs (typically for 4xx or 5xx status codes), our API will return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
}
```
``error``: A concise message explaining what went wrong.

## Handling Errors in Your Code
It's good practice to check the HTTP status code of the response and parse the error body to provide meaningful feedback to your users or for debugging.

### Using Python
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "https://theslow.net/api"

headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Example: Making a request that might result in an error (e.g., invalid endpoint)
try:
    response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/non-existent-endpoint", headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status() # This will raise an HTTPError for 4xx/5xx responses
    print("Request successful:", response.json())
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
    if response.status_code == 401:
        print("Authentication failed. Check your API key.")
    elif response.status_code == 400:
        error_data = response.json()
        print(f"Bad Request: {error_data.get('error')}")
        if 'details' in error_data:
            print(f"Details: {error_data['details']}")
    else:
        print(f"Server responded with status {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as conn_err:
    print(f"Connection error occurred: {conn_err}")
except Exception as err:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {err}")
```
### Using JavaScript (Browser fetch)
```js
async function makeErrorProneCall() {
  const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  const BASE_URL = "https://theslow.net/api";

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/non-existent-endpoint`, { // Example of a bad request
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'X-API-KEY': API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      console.error('API Call Failed with status:', response.status);
      console.error('Error:', errorData.error);
      if (errorData.code) {
        console.error('Error Code:', errorData.code);
      }
      if (errorData.details) {
        console.error('Error Details:', errorData.details);
      }
      return null;
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Request successful:', data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An unexpected network or parsing error occurred:', error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Example usage:
// makeErrorProneCall();
```
