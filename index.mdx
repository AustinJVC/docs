# Welcome to The Slow Net API
Welcome to the official API documentation for The Slow Net!

At The Slow Net, we believe in a philosophy of digital minimalism, calm-tech, and reclaiming attention. Our platform is designed to help you create a focused and intentional online presence. The Slow Net API extends this philosophy by providing programmatic access to manage your account and site features, allowing you to integrate our services seamlessly into your own applications and workflows.

## What You Can Do with the API
The Slow Net API empowers you to:

- Manage Your Account: Retrieve and update your display name.

- Control Email Forwarding: Programmatically toggle your email forwarding status.

- Automate Discord Slowhooks: Send and edit messages to your Discord webhooks, perfect for notifications and integrations.

- Configure Your Site: Get and update your site's visibility, biography, avatar, theme, and content blocks.

## Authentication
For all authenticated requests, you will need an API Key. This key is a ``UUID.SECRET_STRING`` that you can generate directly from your Slow Net dashboard. It must be sent in the ``X-API-Key`` HTTP header for every authenticated request.
