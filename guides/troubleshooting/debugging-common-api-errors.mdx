## Overview

Sometimes your API call might fail. This guide shows the most common issues, what they mean, and how to fix them.

## 401 Unauthorized

**Error:**

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

✅ **Fix:** Make sure your `X-API-KEY` is correct and included in your request headers.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" ...
```

If you recently rotated your key, update your `.env` or CI/CD secrets.

## 409 Conflict (example)

If your API ever adds stricter checks (like preventing duplicate display names), you might see:

```json
{
  "error": "Display name already taken."
}
```

✅ **Fix:** Choose a different name.

> Right now, SlowNet APIs are pretty forgiving. But as more constraints are added, conflicts may appear.

## 500 Internal Server Error

**Error:**

```json
{
  "error": "Could not update site configuration."
}
```

✅ **Fix:** Usually means the SlowNet database had a hiccup, or you sent an incomplete payload. Make sure your JSON is valid and includes all the necessary fields if your endpoint requires them.

## General debugging tips

- Check your JSON payload. Is it valid? Missing a comma?
- Always include your `X-API-KEY`.
- Try sending a simple request first (like just updating mood) to verify your key works.
