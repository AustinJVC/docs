title: Storing and Rotating API Keys
description: Keep your SlowNet API key safe and rotate it if it ever gets compromised.
---

## Overview

Your `X-API-KEY` gives full access to your SlowNet account via the API.  
Treat it like a password: **keep it secret, keep it safe.**

## Storing your API key

### Locally (dev environment)

Use a `.env` file (with something like dotenv) so your key isn’t hard-coded in scripts.

```
SLOWNET_API_KEY=your_long_key_here
```

Then reference it in your code:

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.SLOWNET_API_KEY;
```

Or in bash:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-KEY: $SLOWNET_API_KEY" ...
```

> ✅ **Never commit your `.env` to Git.**  
Add it to your `.gitignore`.

### In CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Store it as a secret in your repo settings under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

Then reference it in your workflow:

```yaml
- run: curl -H "X-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.SLOWNET_API_KEY }}" ...
```

## Rotating your API key

If you think your key might have been leaked, you’ll want to rotate it:

- Delete the old key (or use the dashboard’s rotate feature when available).
- Create a new one and update your `.env` or CI/CD secrets.

If someone else gains access to your key, they can change your site or forward your emails. So rotate it immediately if you suspect compromise.
