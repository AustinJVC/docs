title: Rate Limits
description: To ensure the stability and fair usage of our API for all users, we implement rate limiting. This means there's a limit to the number of requests you can make within a given time period. Understanding and respecting these limits is crucial for building robust applications.

## How Rate Limiting Works
Our API applies rate limits per API key. If you exceed the allowed number of requests, your subsequent requests will be temporarily blocked, and you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code.

## Our Rate Limit Policy
Currently, our general rate limit policy is:

- **60 requests per minute** per API key.

Specific endpoints may have different limits, which will be detailed in their respective API reference documentation.

## Handling Rate Limits
When you receive a ``429 Too Many Requests`` response, your application should pause and retry the request after the X-RateLimit-Reset time, or implement an exponential backoff strategy.

### Exponential Backoff Strategy
Exponential backoff is a standard strategy for retrying failed requests. It involves waiting for increasingly longer periods between retries. This helps to:

- Reduce the load on the API.

- Increase the chance of a successful retry.

- Avoid being permanently blocked.

### Basic Algorithm:

1. Make an API request.

2. If a ``429`` response is received:

- Extract the X-RateLimit-Reset header to determine when to retry.

- Wait until the reset time (or for a calculated duration).

- Retry the request.

3. If other errors occur, consider retrying with increasing delays (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc., up to a maximum).

Example: Handling ``429`` in Python
```python
import requests
import time

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "https://theslow.net/api"
ENDPOINT = "/some-endpoint-that-might-hit-rate-limit" # Replace with an actual endpoint

headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

def make_api_call_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=5):
    retries = 0
    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            if response.status_code == 429:
                reset_time = int(response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Reset', time.time() + 60))
                wait_time = reset_time - int(time.time()) + 1 # Add 1 second buffer
                print(f"Rate limit hit. Waiting for {wait_time} seconds before retrying...")
                time.sleep(max(0, wait_time)) # Ensure wait_time is not negative
                retries += 1
                continue # Retry the request
            response.raise_for_status()
            print("Request successful:", response.json())
            return response.json()
        except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
            print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
            if response:
                print(f"Response body: {response.text}")
            break # Exit on other HTTP errors
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as conn_err:
            print(f"Connection error occurred: {conn_err}")
            time.sleep(2 ** retries) # Exponential backoff for connection errors
            retries += 1
        except Exception as err:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {err}")
            break # Exit on unexpected errors
    print("Max retries exceeded or unhandled error.")
    return None

# Example usage:
# make_api_call_with_retry(f"{BASE_URL}{ENDPOINT}", headers)
```
