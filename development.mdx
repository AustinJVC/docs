Development Resources
This section provides additional information and resources for developers working with The Slow Net API, covering aspects of local development, backend integration, and troubleshooting.

Local Development Setup
To run and test your integrations with The Slow Net API locally, you can point your API calls to the local development server.

Local API Base URL: http://localhost:3000/api/

When running your own application locally, ensure it's configured to use this base URL for API requests during development. This allows you to interact with your local instance of The Slow Net backend (if you are running one) without affecting your live production data.

Supabase Integration Notes
The Slow Net backend utilizes Supabase for its database and authentication services.

API Key vs. Session Authentication
As noted in the Quickstart Guide, our API endpoints support two primary authentication methods:

API Key (Programmatic Access): This is the recommended method for server-side applications, scripts, or any programmatic interaction. The API Key, sent in the X-API-Key header, allows our backend to use the Supabase Service Role Key. This bypasses Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) on user data, enabling full management capabilities for the authenticated user's resources.

Important: The SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is strictly a server-side secret and is never exposed to the client. Your API Key acts as the secure bridge for your programmatic access.

Session/Cookie (Dashboard-Initiated Requests): When you interact with The Slow Net through its web dashboard, standard cookie-based sessions handle authentication. The API routes are designed to work seamlessly with these sessions, providing a consistent experience whether you're using the dashboard or the API directly.

Understanding Row Level Security (RLS)
While your API Key allows our backend to bypass RLS for your data operations, it's beneficial to understand Supabase's RLS if you're building applications that directly interact with Supabase (e.g., a client-side application using the Supabase client library). RLS ensures that users can only access data they are authorized to see, providing a robust security layer. Our API handles these permissions on your behalf when you use an API Key.

Troubleshooting
Common API Errors
401 Unauthorized:

Cause: Missing X-API-Key header, invalid API Key, or expired session.

Solution: Ensure your API Key is correctly included in the X-API-Key header and that it is active. Re-generate if necessary from your dashboard.

400 Bad Request:

Cause: Invalid request body format (e.g., malformed JSON), missing required parameters, or incorrect data types.

Solution: Review the API Reference for the specific endpoint to ensure your request payload matches the expected schema.

404 Not Found:

Cause: Incorrect endpoint URL, or the resource you're trying to access (e.g., a specific message ID for Discord Slowhooks) does not exist.

Solution: Double-check the endpoint path and verify the existence of any resource IDs.

500 Internal Server Error:

Cause: An unexpected error occurred on the server. This could be due to a bug in the API, a database issue, or an unhandled exception.

Solution: While you can't directly fix this, ensure your request is valid. If the issue persists, please report it to The Slow Net support with details of your request.
