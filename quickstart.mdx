# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with The Slow Net API.

---

## 1. Generate Your API Key

All API requests to The Slow Net require an API key for authentication. You can generate and manage your API keys directly from your dashboard.

1.  **Log in to your Slow Net dashboard:**
    [Go to your Dashboard](https://theslow.net/dashboard)

2.  **Navigate to the "Settings" section** at the bottom of the page.

3.  **Find the "API Keys" subsection.**

4.  **Enter an optional "New API Key Name"** (e.g., "My Automation Script") to help you identify its purpose later.

5.  **Click the "Generate New Key" button.**

6.  **Copy the entire API key immediately!** It will be displayed in a yellow box and will be in the format `UUID.SECRET_STRING` (e.g., `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef.your-long-secret-string`).
    **Important:** For security reasons, the full secret part of the key is only shown once. Make sure to store it securely.

## 2. Authenticate Your Requests

To authenticate your API requests, you must include your full API key in a custom HTTP header: `X-API-Key`.

### Header Format

```
X-API-Key: UUID.SECRET_STRING
```

### Example

Here's how you would include your API key in a `curl` request:

```bash copy
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-API-Key: a21894a7-dcb3-4d1a-8ddb-4e9f0585baf4.2500e47bc30423f50967f8d1f38e8d4acba659c607a7a6741693c7515f4c04ab" \
  [https://theslow.net/api/account/get-display-name](https://theslow.net/api/account/get-display-name)
```

**Base URL:** All API endpoints are relative to `https://theslow.net/api/`. For local development, use `http://localhost:3000/api/`.

## 3. Understanding API Responses

The API will return JSON responses.

### Success Responses (2xx Status Codes)

Successful requests will typically return a `200 OK` status code and a JSON object with the requested data.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "some_field": "value"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses (4xx and 5xx Status Codes)

Errors will return an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`) and a JSON object with an `error` message.

```json
{
  "error": "A descriptive error message explaining what went wrong."
}
```
