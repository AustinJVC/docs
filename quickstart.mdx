This guide will get you set up and ready to make your first API call in just a few minutes. Follow these simple steps to begin integrating with our platform.

## Step 1: Sign Up and Get Your API Key

Before you can interact with our APIs, you'll need to sign up for an account and obtain your unique API key.

1. **Sign Up:** If you haven't already, create an account here.

2. **Access Dashboard:** Once signed in, navigate to the settings section of the dashboard (near the bottom!)

3. **Generate API Key:** In the settings, look for the area titled "API Keys." Generate a new API key.

- **Important:** Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly. Treat it like a password. When interacting with most of our general APIs, you will typically pass this key in an X-API-KEY header.

## Step 2: Choose Your Preferred Language/Tool
Our API is designed to be language-agnostic, meaning you can use it with any programming language or tool that can send HTTP requests. Here are some common options:

- **cURL:** For quick command-line testing.

- **Python:** Ideal for scripting and backend applications.

- **JavaScript (Node.js/Browser):** Great for web applications.

## Step 3: Make Your First API Call
Let's make a simple call to verify your setup. We'll use the ``/api/account/get-display-name`` endpoint as an example, which retrieves the display name of the currently authenticated user.

### Using cURL (Command Line)
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual API key you obtained in Step 1.
```
curl -X GET \
  'https://theslow.net/api/account/get-display-name' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Using Python
Create a new Python file (e.g., ``first_call.py``) and add the following code:
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual API key
BASE_URL = "https://theslow.net/api" # All APIs are accessible via this base URL

headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

try:
    response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/account/get-display-name", headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors (4xx or 5xx)
    print("API Call Successful!")
    print(response.json())
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    if response:
        print(f"Response status code: {response.status_code}")
        print(f"Response body: {response.text}")
```
Run the Python script:
```bash
python first_call.py
```

#### Using JavaScript (Browser ``fetch``)
This example demonstrates how to call the API from a web application using ``fetch``. Replace ``YOUR_API_KEY`` with your actual API key.
```js
async function getDisplayName() {
  const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your actual API key
  const BASE_URL = "https://theslow.net/api"; // All APIs are accessible via this base URL

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/account/get-display-name`, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'X-API-KEY': API_KEY, // Pass API key in header
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Handle HTTP errors (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error)
      const errorData = await response.json();
      console.error('API Call Failed:', response.status, errorData.error);
      return null;
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Display Name:', data.display_name);
    return data.display_name;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An unexpected error occurred:', error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Example usage:
// getDisplayName();
```

#### Expected Response
If the call is successful and a display name is available, you should receive a JSON response similar to this:
```json
{
  "display_name": "John Doe"
}
```
Or, in case of an authorization error (e.g., invalid API key):
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```
